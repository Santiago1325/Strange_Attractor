# Strange Attractors
Project for the Modeling and Analysis of Dinamic Systems class.  
The objective is to study some strange attractors, in this case the Lorenz attractor and the RÃ¶ssler attractor.
# App
We designed an app using Matlab's appdesigner feature.  
In this app it is possible to choose one of the two attractors and set the parameters or the initial conditions, then the system can be graphed or animated in 3D
